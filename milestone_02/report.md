# Milestone 02 Report

### Summary of Progress
This week's efforts were focused on refining our major progress made during week one. Unfortunately, 
we didn't understand that the milestones were more focused towards meeting in person with the 
professor or TA, until today. We'll ensure to have formal meetings this week, so that we can
include feedback in these reports going forward. Of note, one of our team members did have a brief
informal meeting with Professor Snelgrove this past week. 

Our progress this week included making a test harness for our sensor input code. This code can be seen
[here](https://github.com/brownbr61/effective-telegram/tree/master/src/Sensor/test). We plan to continuously add to our tests here as we collect more data
and may need to use new filters in our 
sensing process; as such, we have implemented our code using abstract classes to provide this flexibility.


Additionally, we soldered one of our motor drivers to start testing our motors, and ordered our photointerrupters
to use in conjunction with our rotary encoders.
