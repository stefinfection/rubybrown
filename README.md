## Proposal
Hello world. Within this repository lies code to guide one little rover (dubbed Hercules), 
whose purpose is two-fold: to autonomously navigate and complete an obstacle course, and 
to win the gold at a drag race. This project is written in C and works with the STM32F0x8 
Discovery microcontroller by STMicroelectronics. All major components used to build our 
rover can be found in the Bill of Materials, but largely feature simple wheels attached 
to TT motors and infrared sensors to detect obstacles. Specific techniques featured in this 
project include analog to digital conversion (ADC), general purpose input/output (GPIO), 
external interrupts (EXTI), timer interrupts, pulse-width modulation (PWM), and
proportional-integral-derivative motor control (PID). This project encompasses much 
of the knowledge conveyed in CS/CE6780, taught at the University of Utah in the spring of 2023.
