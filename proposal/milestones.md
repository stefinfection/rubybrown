- Pick out chassis
- Proposal

## Milestone 1 (3/17):
##### To Do:
- Deliverables:
  - Lighting Specifications
  - Lighting Bayesian Decision Model
  - Whisker Bayesian Decision Model
- Sensor Data Collection
  - Data Collection system creation
    - *Determine anticipated height & location of light sensors*
      - This is intended to model ambient light noise.
    - *Set up imitation sled.*
      - Raspberry Pi connected to light sensors, record data & output to *.csv for data processing.
    - *Set up imitation cat.*
      - Raspberry Pi connected to whiskers, record data & output to *.csv for data processing.
  - Whisker data collection
    - *deterioration over use?*
    - *deterioration over time?*
    - *intra-whisker performance variance?*
    - *inter-whisker performance variance?*
    - *effects of length on performance?*
    - *Noise associated with rover movement.*
  - Light sensor data collection
    - *Sensitivity to light variance?*
    - *Sensitivity to material variance?*
    - *Decision-making trainability?*
    - *Noise reduction techniques?*
