## The Zoomin' Vroomin'
The Rover will take an input of distance and wait for the "Go" button to be pressed. Upon detection of the stimuli, it will burn out straight forward until $x < 100\%$ of total distance is reached, at which point it will begin to slow down. The Rover will stop upon detection of the presence of the end line through its LED light detectors.
